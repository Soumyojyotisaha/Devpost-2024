# üìù Description <a name="description"></a>

Motion Amplification Video (MAV) is a technique used to visualize and measure vibrations in structures and machinery. This involves processing a video clip, extracting moving features between frames, and amplifying and replaying the motion in each frame. It renders defects at micro scales visible, enabling the determination of vibration amplitudes and mode shapes. This technology finds applications in evaluating noise, vibration, and shock across various platforms, including the automobile, power plants, and other engineering sectors.

# üí° Approach <a name="approach"></a>

1. Input the video into a desktop application containing the object or structure with vibrations to be analyzed.
2. Perform frame-by-frame analysis using a 2-frame approach for motion amplification.
3. Define parameters for motion analysis, such as frame rate, resolution, and analysis duration.
4. Utilize the Lucas-Kanade method (Optical Flow) to calculate motion between consecutive frames.
5. Set up a mask to visualize motion vectors and adjust parameters for point selection and motion accuracy.
6. Visualize motion using red lines and circles.
7. Apply Eulerian Video Magnification to amplify motion in each frame by scaling pixel values, with an adjustable scaling factor.
8. Apply a color map to enhance motion visualization.
9. Generate data, mode shapes, FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) spectrum results, and time waveforms for vibrational analysis, along with detailed reports.
