# üìù Description <a name="description"></a>

Motion Amplification Video (MAV) stands as an innovative technique designed to both visualize and quantify vibrations within structures and machinery. The process entails meticulously analyzing a video clip, identifying dynamic features as they traverse between frames, and subsequently enhancing and replaying these motions in each frame. In effect, MAV unveils imperfections on a micro scale, providing a clear depiction of vibration amplitudes and mode shapes. Its versatile applications extend to the assessment of noise, vibration, and shock in diverse realms, ranging from automobiles to power plants and other facets of the engineering landscape.

# üí° Approach <a name="approach"></a>

1.Integrate the video footage into a sophisticated desktop application that encompasses the targeted object or structure exhibiting vibrations for in-depth analysis.

2.Execute a meticulous frame-by-frame scrutiny employing a cutting-edge 2-frame methodology tailored for motion amplification purposes.

3.Define pivotal parameters governing the motion analysis, including but not limited to frame rate, resolution, and the duration earmarked for analysis.

4.Harness the power of the Lucas-Kanade method, a robust Optical Flow technique, to meticulously compute the motion nuances between successive frames.

5.Establish a comprehensive mask, intricately designed to unveil the intricate web of motion vectors, while fine-tuning parameters governing point selection and motion precision.

6.Illuminate the visual landscape with dynamic red lines and circles, serving as graphic markers to accentuate the detected motion.

7.Deploy the Eulerian Video Magnification technique to intensify motion within each frame, achieved by strategically scaling pixel values with an adaptable scaling factor.

8.Infuse a vibrant color map into the visual output, elevating the motion visualization experience to new heights.

9.Systematically generate a wealth of analytical data, including mode shapes, FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) spectrum results, and time waveforms, forming the bedrock for a comprehensive vibrational analysis. 

10.This meticulous process culminates in the production of detailed reports, providing a holistic understanding of the vibrational dynamics at play.
